# QT6SSTV
QT6 QSSTV - migration of the QSSTV code to QT6 

The QSSTV repro from ON4QZ is used as base for this ' QT 6 update' version.<br>
This repro is to give a fresh start of the great QSSTV programm who was written based on QT5.<p>

The intention of this repro is to add on more functions on the basic QSSTV.<br>
The first step is made - compile the code in QT6<p>

NOTE !!<br>
==>> ALL THE CREDITS ARE MADE FOR ON4QZ <<==<p>
It is possible that this 'new' repro will be merged later on back again to the original QSSTV !
