# QT6SSTV
QT6 QSSTV - migration of the QSSTV code to QT6 

The QSSTV repro from ON4QZ is used as base for this ' QT 6 update' version.<br>
So the main copyrights are from ON4QZ<br>
This repro is to give a fresh start in QT6 of the great QSSTV programm who was written based on QT5.<p>

The intention of this repro is to addon more functions on the 'old' QSSTV program.<br>
The first step is made - compile the code in QT6 and clean the code as most possible<p>

NOTE !!<br>

Their is an documents folder inside the 'src' folder - this folder is in the *.pro file added.<br>
Changes will be made later, also the HTML files to bring the documents online.
